## 🔍 What Triggered the Charges?

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Exceeded Subscription Allowance**
   - Your subscription includes a monthly allocation of premium requests
   - On November 11, you used 18 subscription-included requests, then exceeded the limit
   - The next 62 requests were charged as premium/on-demand usage

2. **Heavy Composer Usage**
   - **76 Composer requests** on November 11 (the charge day)
   - Composer uses premium models (Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking) by default
   - This was significantly higher than your typical usage pattern

3. **Premium Model Selection**
   - You're using **Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking**, which is a premium model
   - Each interaction with this model counts as a premium request when exceeding subscription limits
