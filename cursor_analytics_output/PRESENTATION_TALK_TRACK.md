## 🎯 **Opening Hook** (2 minutes)

> **"Today I'm going to show you something remarkable - data that proves our team has achieved exceptional AI adoption rates that most organizations can only dream of. We're not just using AI tools; we're mastering them."**

**Key Opening Stats:**
- 34.1% of our commits now use AI assistance
- Nearly 20% of our entire codebase is AI-generated
- 12 team members are "power users" with >50% AI adoption
- When developers use AI, they accept 74% of the suggestions on average

**Transition:** *"Let me walk you through the data that tells this success story..."*

## 📊 **Slide 1: AI Adoption Analysis** 
*File: `ai_adoption_analysis.png`*

### **Visual Description:**
*"This is our comprehensive AI adoption overview with four key charts showing different aspects of our AI integration."*

### **Talk Track:**

#### **Top Left - Code Generation Pie Chart:**
> **"Let's start with the big picture. This pie chart shows that 19.4% of all our committed code is AI-generated. That's nearly 1 in 5 lines of code! To put this in perspective, industry benchmarks suggest that 10-15% is considered excellent AI adoption. We're significantly above that."**

**Key Points:**
- 42,053 lines of AI-generated code
- 174,585 lines of manual code
- This represents substantial productivity gains

#### **Top Right - AI Tool Usage Bar Chart:**
> **"Here's where it gets interesting. We have two AI tools available - Tab completions and Composer. Look at this dramatic difference: Composer generated 41,780 lines while Tab completions only generated 273 lines. That's a 153-to-1 ratio!"**

**What This Means:**
- Our developers strongly prefer interactive AI (Composer) over passive suggestions (Tab)
- This tells us where to focus our tool investments
- Interactive, contextual AI assistance is far more valuable than autocomplete

#### **Bottom Left - Commit Types:**
> **"This chart shows that 231 out of 677 commits used AI assistance - that's 34.1%. But here's the key insight: this isn't random usage. This represents consistent, intentional integration of AI into our development workflow."**

#### **Bottom Right - Overall Adoption Rate:**
> **"This final chart visualizes our 34.1% AI adoption rate. More than 1 in 3 commits now include AI assistance. This level of adoption typically takes organizations 12-18 months to achieve. We've done it faster and more effectively."**

**Transition:** *"But adoption is just part of the story. The real question is: are we accepting what AI suggests?"*

## 📈 **Slide 2: AI Acceptance Indicators**
*File: `ai_acceptance_indicators.png`*

### **Visual Description:**
*"These charts reveal something remarkable about how much our developers trust and accept AI suggestions."*

### **Talk Track:**

#### **Left Chart - AI Ratio per Commit:**
> **"This is the smoking gun for AI acceptance. When our developers use AI in a commit, on average 74.2% of that commit is AI-generated code. The median is even higher at 100% - meaning half of our AI-assisted commits are pure AI."**

**What This Proves:**
- Developers aren't just trying AI and rejecting it
- They're accepting the vast majority of AI suggestions
- High acceptance rates indicate high-quality AI output

#### **Right Chart - AI-Heavy Commits:**
> **"Look at these numbers: 167 commits are more than 50% AI-generated, and 141 commits are 95% or more AI-generated. This means our developers are comfortable letting AI write entire features, not just small code snippets."**

**Business Impact:**
- 141 "pure AI" commits = complete features generated by AI
- This represents significant time savings
- Shows deep trust in AI capabilities

**Key Insight:** *"These aren't developers dabbling with AI - these are developers who have integrated AI as a core part of their workflow and are seeing real results."*

**Transition:** *"Now let's look at how this breaks down across our team..."*

## 👥 **Slide 3: User AI Patterns**
*File: `user_ai_patterns.png`*

### **Visual Description:**
*"This analysis reveals how AI adoption varies across our team and identifies our power users."*

### **Talk Track:**

#### **Left Chart - Adoption Rate Distribution:**
> **"This histogram shows the distribution of AI adoption rates across our 31 team members. Notice the red dashed line at 35.8% - that's our team average. But look at the spread: we have developers across the entire spectrum, from occasional users to AI power users."**

**Key Observations:**
- Wide distribution shows different comfort levels
- Multiple peaks suggest different user personas
- Average of 35.8% is industry-leading

#### **Right Chart - User Categories:**
> **"Here's where we can see our success clearly. Out of 31 developers:**
> - **12 are High Adopters** - using AI in more than 50% of their commits
> - **8 are Power Users** - generating more than 30% of their code with AI
> - **19 are Regular Users** - using AI selectively"**

**Strategic Insights:**
- 39% of our team are high adopters (12/31) - exceptional rate
- 26% are power users (8/31) - these are our AI champions
- We have a strong foundation to build on

**Action Items:**
> **"Our strategy should be to learn from these 12 high adopters and help the regular users increase their adoption. We're not starting from zero - we're scaling success."**

**Transition:** *"Let me show you some additional insights from our broader analytics..."*

## 📊 **Slide 4: Supporting Analytics Overview**
*Files: Various existing charts*

### **Daily Activity Chart** (`daily_activity.png`)
> **"This timeline shows our development velocity over the past 63 days. You can see consistent activity with some notable peaks. The key insight is that AI usage is distributed throughout our development cycle, not concentrated in specific periods."**

### **Repository Activity Chart** (`repository_activity.png`)
> **"Here are our most active repositories. Notice that infrastructure and API projects like 'sre-central-api' and 'terraform_mvp' show the highest AI usage. This makes sense - AI excels at generating configuration files, boilerplate code, and structured APIs."**

### **Team Overview Chart** (`team_overview.png`)
> **"Our team structure supports AI adoption well. We have the right mix of experience levels and roles to support both AI experimentation and best practice sharing."**
